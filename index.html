          <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">About Me</h1>
          <p>Hey guys, I'm <strong>Finley</strong>, the founder and one of the coaches here at <strong>F7 Coaching</strong>. I’m an outgoing, confident, and approachable individual with a passion for football and personal development.</p>
          <p>Throughout my journey in professional football, I’ve developed a strong work ethic, resilience, and a can-do attitude that allows me to overcome challenges and continuously improve.

        <div class="framework-item">
          <h3>Ball Mastery</h3>
          <p>This is the foundation of all great footballers. It is all about developing close control, first touch and the ability to manipulate the ball in tight spaces. The more comfortable players are with the ball at thier feet, the more confident they become in making decisions under pressure. Ball mastery drills teach players to use all parts of their feet-inside, outside and sole whilst also improving balance, co-ordination and touch. Whether it is dribbling, passing or receiving, the more skillful a player is in these situations, the better they'll perform during matches.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="framework-item">
          <h3>1v1 Duels</h3>
          <p>These duels are a vital aspect of individual battles on the field. Whether defending or attacking, these duels test a players ability to outplay or outsmart their opponent in direct confrontations. In attack, it is about using skill, pace and creativity to beat a defender and create scoring oppertunities. In defence it is about positioning, timing and making key tackles to regain possession. 1V1 duels help players develop mental toughness and resilience, making them more comfortable when isolated in crucial moments during a game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="framework-item">
          <h3>Game Related Practices</h3>
          <p>These practices bridge the gap between training and match situations. These drills mimic the flow of a real game and focus on decision-making, transitions and tactical awareness. By replicating the intensityand scenarios found in matches, players learn how to apply their technical skills and tactical understanding in dynamic real-world situations. Game related practices hlep players improve their ability to read the game, communicate with team mates and adapt to the changing circumstances on the pitch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="framework-item">
          <h3>Small Sided Games</h3>
          <p>These games are essential for player development as they maximise touches on the ball, increase decision-making oppertunities and enchance tactical awareness. With fewer players on the field, each individual has more involvement and responsability, which accelerates learning. SSGs promote quick thinking, spatial awareness and the ability to make fast decisions under pressure. They also help players improve their fitness, adaptability and teamwork as they experience more oppertunities to engage in both attacking and defending.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="framework-item">
          <h3>Cognitive Training</h3>
          <p>This training in football is all about enchancing a players mental sharpness. It involves developing the brain's ability to process information quickly and accurately under pressure, which is essential during high-intensity moments of a match. This type of training focuses on improving the players vision, reaction times, decision-making and ability to anticipate the opponents next move. Cognative training drills often include tasks that require multitasking, pattern recognition and mental focus. A player who excels mentaly on the pitch can better read the game, make intelligent decisions and stay composed during critical moments.</p>
